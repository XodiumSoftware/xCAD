## UI

<div align="center" data-full-width="false">

<figure><img src=".gitbook/assets/ui.png" alt=""><figcaption><p>screenshot of the UI</p></figcaption></figure>

</div>

Basically the idea is to have a editor to adjust the parameters of predefined objects. those objects are designed with logical scalability in mind, which in our opinion is lacking in the industry.
