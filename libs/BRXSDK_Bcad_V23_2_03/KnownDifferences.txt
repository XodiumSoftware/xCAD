This file contains informations about known differences to ObjectARX behaviour
and interfaces.


BModeler - differences to ARX AModeler :
========================================

Faces + Holes iteration + identification :
------------------------------------------
BricsCAD BModeler does not use "bridge edges" internally to describe the face topology;
instead, BModeler uses "face loops" - the function "extractAllLoops()" provides the list
of faces, the first face loop is the outermost always, any further face loop describes a hole.

especially for dwg persistent bodies :
"bridge edges" are supported during dwgInFields(), to establish the "face loops" structures;
during dwgOutFields(), the core modeler re-creates "bridge edges" to keep compatibility with ARX
AModeler.

The "extractAllLoops()" mechanism is also available with ARX AModeler - so this is the prefered
way to iterate + analyse faces with their holes.


AcEd interface :
================

struct resbuf * acedGetArgs()
-----------------------------
ARX :
the returned argument list is dynamically created, but under management of ARX;
client code is allowed to release this memory by acutRelRb(), but not enforced to do so
(ARX simply ignores this call, and later releases that memory under own control)

BRX :
with BRX, client code should explicitely release this memory, otherwise a memory leak
will appear

Suggestion :
as ARX simply does not release the resbuf list returned by acedGetArgs(), it is safe
and reliable to use acutRelRb(args) with both ARX and BRX, so developers can use
unified code here


different Jigger logic
----------------------
The built-in commands like MOVE, COPY, etc. use jigger loops to generate dragged entities'
graphics like in AutoCAD/ARX.
But there is a major design difference :
- AutoCAD creates and drags a new entity clone for each mouse move cycle
- BricsCAD uses only a single clone, created at beginning of the jigger operation
  => as result, there are no "clone()" calls during following mouse move cycles,
     as the initially created clone is used
ARX application might need to adjust their logic, if this different logic causes a problem.


Custom Entities + Objects
-------------------------
With AutoCAD ARX, it is possible to create custom objects and entities, without having
RunTime-Type-Information available - this is, declaring the custom object/entity without
using ACRX_DECLARE_MEMBERS and corresponding ACRX_DXF_DEFINE_MEMBERS (and its variants)
macros from rxboiler.h header.

Such entities behave like normal entities of the base-class used, and all virtual overridable
functions are properly used and called.
When saving to dwg/dxf file, such objects/entities are saved as base-class items.

In BRX, there is a minor, but fundamental difference - without RTTI available, such Objects
and entities are treated as pure base-class items, not as custom objects / entities.
As result, all the virtual overridable functions are *NOT* called on such custom object/entity
instances.
When saving to dwg/dxf file, such objects/entities are saved as base-class items, like with ARX.

Background :
The problem here is, that BRX has to manage BRX custom objects/entities, and instantiate the
associated Teigha(TX) custom objects/entities - then, the BRX system handles this association,
including virtual overridable functions.
You can imagine this as a "man-in-the-middle" (or placeholder) object/entity, which is added
between client custom object/entity and the related Teigha(TX) in class hierarchy.

This means, using ACRX_DECLARE_MEMBERS and ACRX_DXF_DEFINE_MEMBERS (and its variants) is mandatory
for BRX custom objects/entities, if calling the virtual overridable functions is required.

* Teigha(TX) is the underlying database engine, provided by ODA Alliance, used by BricsCAD


using RTTI macros
-----------------
As mentioned above, RTTI is required for database-resident custom objects and entities.
For transient objects (like database + editor + document reactors), RTTI is not required;
but if RTTI is used for transient custom objects, the <Class>::rxInit() must be called as well;
that is not necessary under AutoCAD ARX - here, transient custom objects using RTTI macros
do not need ::rxInit() to be called.
But due to custom objects management (see above,) calling ::rxInit() is necessary under BRX.
Alternatively :
do not use RTTI macros for transient objects - this works fine in both ARX and BRX environment.


COM interface usage
-------------------

Out-of-Process COM applications must use the correct TypeLibrary files (x86 or x64)
versions, when running with x86 resp. x64 BricsCAD;
this is different compared to AutoCAD, as it can install x86 version only under Windows x86,
and x64 version only under Windows x64.

Please see "PortingManual.txt" for more details.


Cloning details related to AcDbIdMapping
----------------------------------------
Due to different logic in objects cloning at Teigha (TD) side, compared to ARX, we
observed cases where BRX is not fully able to "hide" (or adapt) the BRX side behaviour
to fully match ARX.

Known case 1 :
as observed, the AcDbIdMapping sometimes contains AcDbIdPair with valid key AcDbObjectId,
but the value is set as kNull; this is caused by mentioned difference in cloning logic at
Teigha database side.
Such case never seems to happen with ARX.
Client code who wants to add an AcDbIdPair(key, value) to AcDbIdMapping will fail with
Acad::eHandleExists error status when assigning the AcDbIdPair to AcDbIdMapping.

Workaround is simple :
simply remove that AcDbIdPair before using assign() function

    AcDbIdPair pair(idMyKey, kNull, false, false);
    bool status = idMap.compute(pair);
    if (status && pair.value.isNull())  // key ID is already present, check value
    {
        idMap.del(pair);
    }
    // update pair with intended clone, if clone exists or was already created
    pair.setValue(idTargetCloneOrObject);
    Acad::ErrorStatus es = idMap.assign(pair);

This code will work with both ARX and BRX environment (as that case likely never happens
in ARX), and is especially safe if ARX will ever change to have AcDbIdPair with value=kNull
in its cloning AcDbIdMapping.
