To compile for BricsCAD, define the environment variable "BRX23_SDK_PATH" and set it
to the root folder where you placed the BRX SDK (for example "C:\BrxSdk").

To compile for:
-- AutoCAD 2018: define the environment variable "ARX2018_SDK_PATH" and set it
to the root folder where you placed the ObjectARX SDK (for example "C:\ObjectARX2018");
-- AutoCAD 2019/2020: define the environment variable "ARX2019_SDK_PATH";
-- AutoCAD 2021/2022: define the environment variable "ARX2021_SDK_PATH";

Props: the Visual Studio projects of this sample use property sheets. These are .props files
located in build/props folder. Each file stores project settings related to a certain library,
e.g. brx23.props for BRX 23 SDK.

Check your global include folders in Visual Studio 2019 (Tools/Options/Project and
Solutions/VC++ Directories), and avoid any include folders to the ObjectARX SDK there,
as this might confuse the build configurations for BricsCAD (Debug_Bcad and Release_Bcad).

When you have defined the environment variables, you have to close and restart all 
Visual Studio 2019 instances, otherwise they will not be recognized.
